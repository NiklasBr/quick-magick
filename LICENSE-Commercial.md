## Questions and answers

### Won't one person just be able to donate once to get a BSD-3 license and then pass it on to the rest of the world?

Yes. It would be legal to do so. But I ask you in a social setting, to please don't. This software is already available under a very free and open source AGPL license, please honour it and help those in need.

### For how long will the warranty and fitness-for-purpose promise be valid?

The limited warranty and fitness-for-purpose promise will be valid for one year, starting on the day of your choice.
